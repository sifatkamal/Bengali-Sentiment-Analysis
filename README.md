# Bengali-Sentiment-Analysis

I have made this project in my data science for the practitioners course (CSE438) along with my teammates Saurav Das, Kaushik Roy and Md. Mahfujul Hoque Saurav. In this project we have used 3 deep learning models to determine the sentiments such as: BERT, LSTM, and MLP Classifier. We trained the model using a Bengali sentiment dataset with a list of sentiments and sentences. Sentiments are either positive or negative according to the sentences.
